# DGLD_GuardianCommandConsole
DGLD-CBT GuardNode Command Console

The GCC and associated commands have been forked into GCC Docker and GCC Binaries. Binaries are leaner (option to self compile code also coming) so Docker version will be retired soon. Both can be installed simultaneously but can only run one at a time - if you have the docker version running already the same data folders will be used automatically but please make sure you back your wallet and keys up just in case
